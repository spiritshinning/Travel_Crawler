The Nguyễn dynasty (Chữ Nôm: 茹阮, Vietnamese: Nhà Nguyễn; Hán tự: 阮朝, Vietnamese: Nguyễn triều) was the last Vietnamese dynasty, which ruled the unified Vietnamese state largely independently from 1802 to 1884. During its existence, the empire expanded into modern-day southern Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos through a continuation of the centuries-long Nam tiến and Siamese–Vietnamese wars.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Third_Era_of_Northern_Domination
The Third Era of Northern Domination refers to the third period of Chinese rule in Vietnamese history. The era starts from the end of the Vạn Xuân Kingdom in 602 to the rise of the local Khuc family and other Viet warlords in the early 10th century, finally ending in 938 after the defeat of Southern Han armada by the Viet leader Ngo Quyen. This period saw two Chinese imperial dynasties rule over northern Vietnam. The Sui Empire ruled northern Vietnam from 602 to 618, and briefly reoccupied central Vietnam in 605. The successive Tang Empire ruled northern Vietnam from 621 to 880.@en

The Restored Lê period is marked by two lengthy civil wars: the Lê–Mạc War (1533–1592) in which two dynasties battled for legitimacy in northern Vietnam and the Trịnh–Nguyễn War (1627–1672) between the Trịnh family in T@en
