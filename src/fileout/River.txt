The upper part of this river is sloping, therefore rain water from Annamite Range flows violently to the lower part in rainy seasons (in autumn), causing floods in it basin. Thanks to An Ma Dam, this situation has been stopped. Unlike other rivers in Vietnam which flow southeast, the Kiến Giang River flows northeast, and creates a narrow delta in Lệ Thủy District. Like all of the rivers in Central Vietnam, this river water is clear, which means that it carries little alluvium@en
